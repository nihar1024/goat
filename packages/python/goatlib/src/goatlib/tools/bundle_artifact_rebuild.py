"""BundleArtifactRebuild Tool - rebuild a bundle's artifacts from its member layers.

The member layers are the source of truth for a bundle's derived artifacts, so
this is what turns an edit into a new routable graph. It is also the way back
for an artifact left at ``pending`` or ``failed``.

Publishing is guarded by the bundle's ``layers_revision``: a save that lands
mid-build queues its own rebuild, so a build overtaken that way discards its
output and leaves the artifact stale for the newer build to publish.

Usage:
    from goatlib.tools.bundle_artifact_rebuild import (
        BundleArtifactRebuildParams,
        main,
    )

    result = main(BundleArtifactRebuildParams(
        user_id="...",
        bundle_id="...",
    ))
