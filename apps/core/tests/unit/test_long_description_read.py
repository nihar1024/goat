"""A description already in the database must never break reading it back.

`ContentBaseAttributes.description` carries `max_length=2000`, which Pydantic
enforces whenever the model is validated — including when a READ model is built
out of a row. The column itself is `Text`, and a promoted catalog layer copies
the provider's description verbatim: 582 of the catalog's 34,760 items are
longer than 2000 characters, the longest 11,559. One such layer in a project
made `GET /project/{id}/layer` fail outright, so the whole project stopped
loading rather than that one layer.

The limit belongs on input. Reading is not the place to discover that stored
data is too long — there is nothing the user can do about it.
