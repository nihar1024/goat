"""The published assets a client may fetch through this API.

Two of them, and only two: the **thumbnail** a card shows and the **style** the
map draws a dataset with. Both are small (31 MB and 5.8 MB across the whole
catalog, 27.6 KB and 0.56 KB mean), both are GOAT's own products, and both are
useless to a client that cannot fetch them.

The harmonised GeoParquet is deliberately absent. It has no route, no signed
URL and no private URL: the only reader is this service's own preview, which
range-reads at most 100 features out of an 81 GB prefix. "Not downloadable" is
expressed as "no URL exists", not as a permission check that could be relaxed by
accident.

Three properties worth stating, because each is a decision:

* **The bucket stays private.** Bytes are read with the service's credentials and
  streamed; nothing is signed and no public prefix is opened, so a client never
  learns where the object lives and there is no URL to copy, replay or share.
* **The caller names an item, not an object.** A request is "the thumbnail of
  this dataset". The object key is resolved from that item's own published href,
  so the reachable set is what the harvester pointed at -- not what a caller can
  spell. No request segment is ever concatenated into a key.
* **The kind decides the media type.** A publisher-adjacent `type` field is not
  echoed: it must be one this kind serves, or the request fails. An SVG served
  from our origin with a `text/html` label would be script execution in the
  origin that holds the session.
