## White Label

Under **White Label**, you can publish dashboards on your own domain and configure analytics tracking for published dashboards. White Label settings apply to the whole organization and are accessible to organization owners.

### Custom Domains

**Publish your dashboards on your own domain.** Each domain serves one published project. To assign a domain to a project, use the Share dialog in the Dashboard Builder.

**To add a custom domain:**

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">1</div>
  <div class="content">Click <code>+ Add your first domain</code> (empty state) or <code>+ Add custom domain</code>.</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">2</div>
  <div class="content">In the <strong>Add custom domain</strong> dialog, enter your <code>Domain name</code> — either a subdomain (e.g. <code>dashboards.example.com</code>) or an apex domain (e.g. <code>example.com</code>). Click <code>Continue</code>.</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">3</div>
  <div class="content">The <strong>Configure DNS</strong> step opens, showing the exact record to create at your DNS provider. The record depends on your domain type:
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Subdomain</strong> (e.g. <code>maps.example.com</code>):
    <table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Host</th><th>Target</th><th>TTL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CNAME</td><td>maps</td><td>cname.goat.plan4better.de</td><td>3600</td></tr></tbody></table>
    <br/>
    <strong>Apex domain</strong> (e.g. <code>example.com</code>):
    <table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Host</th><th>Target</th><th>TTL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>@</td><td>46.225.38.48</td><td>3600</td></tr></tbody></table>
    <br/>
    The dialog includes copy buttons for each value. GOAT checks DNS propagation every 30 seconds automatically. Click <code>Recheck now</code> to trigger an immediate check, or <code>Done</code> to close and wait in the background.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">4</div>
  <div class="content">Once DNS is verified, the dialog shows a <strong>DNS verified</strong> confirmation and GOAT issues an SSL certificate from <strong>Let's Encrypt</strong> automatically — usually under 2 minutes. The domain status changes to <strong>Issuing</strong> and then <strong>Active</strong> once the certificate is ready.</div>
</div>

**Domain statuses in the list:**

| Status | Description | Available actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Waiting for DNS | DNS record not yet detected | Show DNS, Recheck |
| Issuing | DNS verified, SSL certificate being issued | Details |
| Active | Domain is live and serving dashboards | Unassign (if assigned), Delete |
| Failed | DNS or certificate provisioning failed | Details, Retry, Delete |

To view DNS record details or troubleshoot a failed domain, click **Details** or **Show DNS** to open the domain detail drawer, which shows the current DNS and certificate status messages and a **Recheck now** button.

To remove a domain from a project without deleting it, use the project's **Share** dialog. The **Unassign** button in the domain list is only shown when the domain is active and assigned.

### Analytics

**Configure analytics tracking for your published dashboards.** You can add multiple analytics instances — one per Matomo site. Tracking is opt-in per dashboard via the Share dialog.

GOAT currently supports **Matomo** as the analytics provider.

**To add an analytics instance:**

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">1</div>
  <div class="content">Click <code>+ Add analytics</code>.</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">2</div>
  <div class="content">In the <strong>Add analytics</strong> dialog, fill in:
    <ul>
      <li><code>Name</code> — a label to tell instances apart, e.g. <code>Client XY Matomo</code>.</li>
      <li><code>Provider</code> — select <code>Matomo</code>.</li>
      <li><code>Matomo URL</code> — your Matomo instance URL including trailing slash (e.g. <code>https://matomo.example.org/</code>).</li>
      <li><code>Site ID</code> — found in Matomo → Administration → Websites.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">3</div>
  <div class="content">Click <code>Save</code>.</div>
</div>

Each instance in the list shows the Matomo URL, Site ID, and how many published dashboards use it. You can **edit** or **remove** an instance using the icons on the right, and use **Manage dashboards** to assign or unassign dashboards to that analytics instance.

:::tip
Add each of your custom domains to your Matomo site's URL list, and configure Custom Dimension 1 as "Project ID" so per-dashboard breakdown works in Matomo.
