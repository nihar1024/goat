/**
 * 2.3 Delete stop (01-editing-operations § 2; board 29): the stop goes from
 * the network, and from every trip that calls there. Later stops keep their
 * times; stop sequences are not renumbered (GTFS needs them increasing, not
 * consecutive). The cascade, in one change:
 *
 * - its stop times go, and any extras they had;
 * - each pattern through it loses it, and becomes another pattern of its
 *   route where that one runs the same stops (a short turn that differed
 *   only by this stop), its trips with it;
 * - a trip's first and last times, and its length where that is measured
 *   from its stops (the feed's distances, or stop to stop), follow;
 * - a trip that ended here and was headed for it is headed for its new last
 *   stop (`trip_headsign_matches_intermediate_stop` otherwise);
 * - the line through the stops, for trips without a shape, is drawn anew;
 * - transfers, pathways and stop areas naming it go on save (the server's
 *   cascade: the browser holds none).
 *
 * Refused, with the reason, when a trip would keep fewer than two stops
 * (`unusable_trip`, stricter in GOAT), would start or end, where it did not
 * before, at a stop without a time (`missing_trip_edge`), or is
 * frequency-based and would lose the first stop its runs are timed from
 * (`goat_frequency_start`): no time is ever made up.
 *
 * What lies under a stop or platform (its boarding areas, or whatever a feed
 * puts there) goes with it; a stop or platform under it is kept, on its own.
 *
 * A station goes with everything under it: its stops and platforms, each
 * as above, in the one change and under the same refusals, and its
 * entrances and generic nodes (cascade decided 5 Nov 2026). Any other
 * location (an entrance, a node) is called at by no trip: it goes alone.
