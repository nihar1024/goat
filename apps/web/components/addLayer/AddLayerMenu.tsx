 * of collections — and a menu says that plainly: you pick before anything opens, and what
 * opens is sized for the one job. A tab bar instead promised interchangeable views and made
 * one frame morph between two widths.
 *
 * The trigger stays with the host: the layer panel's is a full-width button in a sidebar
 * and the datasets page's sits in a toolbar, and neither should be this component's
