"""DuckLake compaction task.

Where ``ducklake_maintenance`` reclaims space (expire snapshots + delete
catalog-tracked / filesystem orphans), THIS task addresses small-file
proliferation: tables that accumulate many tiny parquets from incremental
INSERTs (e.g., user feature edits, append-style syncs).

DuckLake's INSERT model is additive at the file level — every commit
writes a NEW parquet rather than merging into an existing one. After
30 individual feature adds, a layer has 1 big initial parquet + 30
tiny parquets, all ``end_snapshot=NULL`` (i.e. all "current"). Cleanup
won't touch them because they ARE the current data. To consolidate
them you need compaction.

Compaction here uses two DuckLake primitives:

  ``ducklake_merge_adjacent_files(catalog, schema, table, max_file_size, min_file_size)``
    Rewrites multiple small adjacent parquets into a single larger
    parquet. Small originals are marked ``end_snapshot=N`` (superseded).
    The merged parquet is the new current state.

  ``ducklake_cleanup_old_files(catalog, cleanup_all => true)``
    Same call ``ducklake_maintenance`` uses — physically deletes the
    files compaction just marked superseded. Run inline here so a
    single compaction execution actually frees disk, instead of waiting
    for the next maintenance pass.

Targeting: we only call ``merge_adjacent_files`` on tables that have
at least ``min_files_per_table`` current parquets AND at least one
of them is below ``small_file_threshold_mib``. Skip tables with one
big parquet (already optimal) and tables with a few big parquets
(merging produces no benefit, just I/O).

Safety properties (verified by tests and the safety check script):
  - Only "current" files (end_snapshot=NULL) are considered.
  - Compaction itself does not delete data — it rewrites + supersedes.
  - The optional cleanup_after step deletes superseded files, exactly
    the same safe path ``ducklake_maintenance`` uses.
