"""Jobs the user never started must be marked, not silently dropped.

`catalog_materialize` runs because someone added a catalog layer; the layer
tree already reports it ("Preparing data …", "Data preparation failed") next to
the layer it belongs to, where it can be identified and re-added. The job list
carries the flag so a client can leave it out, while the API still returns it
for anyone debugging.
