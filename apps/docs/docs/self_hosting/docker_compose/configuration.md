# Configuration reference

The whole configuration lives in the file `.env` in the bundle folder. `setup.sh` creates it from `.env.example`, which documents every setting with comments. This page lists the settings in the same groups.

- **Set by setup.sh** means that `setup.sh` fills the value: secrets are generated once when empty, and derived values are rewritten from the public URL and the TLS mode on every run. Do not edit derived values by hand; run `setup.sh` instead.
- A setting shown as *(commented out)* is present in `.env.example` but inactive until you remove the `#`.

Apply changes with `docker compose up -d`.
