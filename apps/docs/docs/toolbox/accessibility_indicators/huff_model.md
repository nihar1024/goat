# Huff Model

The Huff Model **predicts the probability of consumers in a reference area visiting particular locations** based on the attractiveness of the locations and the distance to those locations, including competition between opportunities. The Huff Model focuses on **competitive market share**.

## 1. Explanation

The Huff Model is a **spatial interaction model that estimates how demand (e.g., customers, residents) is distributed among competing supply locations (e.g., stores, facilities)**. 
The model works on a simple principle: **a location's probability of being chosen depends on its attractiveness relative to all competing locations, weighted by travel time**. A large, nearby shopping center will capture more demand than a small, distant one — but the exact split depends on the balance of attractiveness and distance for all available options.

The result is a **probability score for each supply location**, representing the share of total demand it captures from the reference area. This enables direct comparison of how well different facilities compete for the same customer base.

You can configure the routing type, opportunity layers (with capacity fields), demand layer (with population field), reference area, travel time limits, and calibrate your model.

- **Reference area** — A polygon defining the study area. Only demand and opportunities within this area are considered.

- The **Opportunity layers contain facility data** with an attractivity attribute (e.g., number of hospital beds, square meters of retail space, school seats).

- The **Demand layer contains population or user data** (e.g., number of residents, potential customers) that represents the demand for the facilities.



**Key difference:** Unlike the Heatmaps, which visualizes accessibility per grid cell, the *Huff Model* produces a **probability per supply location** — showing what share of total demand each facility captures.

:::info 

The Huff Model is available in certain regions. Upon selecting a `Routing type`, a **geofence** will be displayed on the map to highlight supported regions.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <MapViewer
      geojsonUrls={[
        "https://assets.plan4better.de/other/geofence/geofence_heatmap.geojson"

## 2. Example use cases

- How much market share does each supermarket capture from surrounding residential areas?

- Where should a new retail store be opened to maximize customer reach while considering existing competitors?

- How would adding a new school affect enrollment distribution across existing schools?

- What share of demand does each public library capture from surrounding neighborhoods?

  <div class="content">Choose the <code>Demand Field</code> — a numeric field from your demand layer representing the number of potential consumers (e.g., population, number of households).</div>

### Opportunities

  <div class="content">Optionally, adjust the <code>Distance Decay</code> parameter (default: 2.0) to control how strongly travel time reduces a facility's appeal. Higher values mean people are less willing to travel far.</div>

:::info Model Calibration

For realistic results, the Huff Model parameters should be **calibrated using observed market share or user choice data**. The default parameters may not reflect actual customer behavior in your study area.
Ideally, collect data on actual customer visits or market shares to estimate optimal parameters.

**Note:** Automated parameter calibration is not currently available in GOAT. You can manually adjust the parameters.

  <div class="content">Click <code>Run</code> to start the calculation.</div>
</div>

### Results

Once the calculation is complete, a result layer will be added to the map. Each feature in the result layer represents a **supply location** with its computed Huff probability.

- **Higher probability** values indicate that a facility captures a larger share of the total demand — it is more competitive relative to alternatives.
- **Lower probability** values indicate that a facility captures less demand, either because it is less attractive, farther away, or faces strong competition from nearby alternatives.

## 4. Technical details

### Calculation

The Huff Model computes the probability that demand from location *i* flows to supply location *j*:

<MathJax.Provider>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontSize: '24px' }}>
    <MathJax.Node formula={"P_{ij} = \\frac{A_j^{\\alpha} \\cdot d_{ij}^{-\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_k^{\\alpha} \\cdot d_{ik}^{-\\beta}}"} />
  </div>
</MathJax.Provider>

Where:
- *P<sub>ij</sub>* = probability that demand at location *i* visits supply location *j*
- *A<sub>j</sub>* = attractiveness of supply location *j*
- *d<sub>ij</sub>* = travel time from demand location *i* to supply location *j*
- *α* = attractiveness parameter (default: 1.0)
- *β* = distance decay parameter (default: 2.0)
- *n* = number of supply locations reachable from *i*

The **captured demand** for each supply location is then computed by multiplying the probability by the demand value at each origin and summing across all origins:

<MathJax.Provider>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontSize: '24px' }}>
    <MathJax.Node formula={"C_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} P_{ij} \\cdot D_i"} />
  </div>
</MathJax.Provider>

Where:
- *C<sub>j</sub>* = total captured demand at supply location *j*
- *D<sub>i</sub>* = demand (population) at location *i*
- *m* = number of demand locations

The final **Huff probability** reported per supply location is the share of total demand it captures:

<MathJax.Provider>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontSize: '24px' }}>
    <MathJax.Node formula={"H_j = \\frac{C_j}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} D_i}"} />
  </div>
</MathJax.Provider>
