"""GOAT Usage snapshot — gauge emitter for the "GOAT - Usage" Grafana dashboard.

Runs as a Kubernetes CronJob (every 5 min), queries GOAT's Postgres via the
existing async session manager, and pushes a fixed set of OTel gauges through
the alloy-receiver OTLP endpoint that goatobs already speaks to. Each gauge
maps 1:1 to a panel in ``argocd/apps/o11y/grafana/dashboards/goat-usage.json``.

Invocation::

    python -m core.scripts.usage_snapshot

Env vars consumed (via ``goatobs.setup_observability`` and ``settings``):

* ``OTEL_ENABLED`` -- must be ``true`` for any metric to be exported.
* ``ENVIRONMENT`` -- ``dev`` / ``prod`` etc, used as ``deployment.environment``.
* ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` -- gRPC endpoint of the local Alloy receiver.
* GOAT Postgres connection vars (``POSTGRES_*`` -> ``ASYNC_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI``).

Exit codes:

* ``0`` -- every query succeeded; ``goat_usage_snapshot_last_success_timestamp_seconds``
  was advanced.
* ``1`` -- at least one query failed; the gauges for failed queries keep their
  previous value in Mimir, ``goat_usage_snapshot_query_errors_total{query_name=...}``
  was incremented, and Kubernetes records the CronJob run as failed.

Each query runs in its own ``try/except`` so one broken query does not prevent
the rest from publishing.

# Strategy: suffix the name ONLY when it collides, using the owner's
# full email as the human-readable disambiguator. The owner is the
# user with the `organization-owner` role (see core/db/seed_roles.py)

# multiple owners we pick MIN(email) deterministically; if it has zero

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Windmill metrics — cross-DB (goat user_id ↔ Windmill args.user_id UUID join)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Windmill stores every user-triggered job's GOAT user UUID in
# `v2_job.args -> 'user_id'`. We use that to attribute jobs back to GOAT
# orgs without needing fragile email-string matching.
#
# Implementation flow (all driven from `snapshot()` below):
#  1. Open a second async connection to the Windmill DB.
#  2. Fetch a user_uuid → (org_id, org_name) dict from the GOAT DB
#     (using the same ORG_DISAMBIG_CTE so the org_name labels match
#     what other goat_* metrics emit).
#  3. Run aggregation queries against Windmill, post-process each row
#     to attach the org labels via the dict.
#  4. Stash the resulting Observation lists in `_OBSERVATIONS`.
#  5. Register ObservableGauge instruments whose callbacks just read
#     from the cache. `force_flush()` then collects and exports.
#
# Why ObservableGauge (not Counter):
# `goat_jobs_count` and friends represent activity in the LAST cron
# window (5 minutes), not cumulative-since-forever. Dashboards integrate
# with `sum_over_time(goat_jobs_count[$__range])`. Counters would have
# been wrong because Windmill's 30-day retention drops old jobs from
# `v2_job_completed`, so a counter sourced from that table would appear
# to reset/decrease — which `rate()` / `increase()` interpret as a real
# counter reset and double-count after the boundary. Per-window gauges
# don't have this failure mode.
