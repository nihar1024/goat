"""The ``datetime`` filter against every temporal shape STAC allows.

The shared fixture dates every row as an instant, which is what the harvester
publishes *today* (contract C11: no ``start_datetime``, and 3,834 of 3,834
Collections carry ``extent.temporal.interval == [[null, null]]``). That corpus
cannot tell a correct temporal filter from one that happens to work on instants,
so this module publishes the other shapes deliberately:

* an **instant** -- ``datetime`` only,
* a **range** -- ``datetime: null`` + ``start_datetime``/``end_datetime``, which
  the Item spec requires be spelled exactly that way,
* an **open-ended range** -- a start with no end ("everything since 2020"),
* **undated** -- neither, which is over half the live catalog,

and asserts what a search returns for each. The bug this guards against is not
hypothetical: the mirror used to store one timestamp per row, read from
``extent.temporal.interval[1][1]`` -- the END of the FIRST interval -- so a
dataset covering 2014-2021 was stored as an instant at 2021 and a search for
2015 could not find it.

Written against the real converter (``build_mirror``) and the real store rather
than hand-written SQL, so it fails if either side of the contract moves.
