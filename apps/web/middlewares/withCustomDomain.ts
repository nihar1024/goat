/**
 * If the incoming Host header is not the canonical app host, try to
 * resolve it as a customer's custom domain and rewrite the request to
 * the public-dashboard route for the assigned project.
 *
 * Runs first in the stack — withAuth's `publicPaths` ("/map/public")
 * exemption then naturally permits the rewritten request.
 *
 * Unknown hosts fall through to existing routing (typically a 404 from
 * Next.js for an unrecognized origin), which is the desired behavior:
 * we never silently serve someone else's content from an unbound host.
