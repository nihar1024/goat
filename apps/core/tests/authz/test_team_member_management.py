"""Only a team's owner manages its members; a member may leave on their own.

Adding and removing members has its own resources (``read-team``), so the
decision is the handler's: the caller must own the team to add anyone or to
remove someone else, the added user must belong to the team's organization,
and the owner cannot remove themselves (the team would have no owner left).
