"""Real published documents must survive JSON -> columns -> JSON.

``catalog.parquet``'s ``document`` column is a *cache* of a transformation: the
converter folds the published columns into STAC JSON at sync time, and the
service parses that JSON, rewrites links and re-serialises it per request. This
module asserts the precondition for ever removing that cache -- that the
published columns carry enough to rebuild the document -- using the real
harvester output captured in ``tests/fixtures/real``.

It is also the regression guard for the converter's tolerance of published
schema drift: the fixtures here carry a ``summaries`` struct with no ``updated``
member, which used to abort the whole mirror build with a bind error.
