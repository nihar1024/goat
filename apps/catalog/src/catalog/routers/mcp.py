"""MCP server exposing the GOAT catalog as tools for LLM clients.

Mounted into the catalog FastAPI app at ``/mcp`` (Streamable HTTP) --
see ``catalog.app.create_app``, which imports this module lazily and
guards the import so a broken/missing ``mcp`` install never takes down
the HTTP API (see that module's docstring for the guard). ``create_app``
also wraps the mount in ``catalog.auth.BearerAuthASGIMiddleware`` (the same
bearer-token gate that ``/stac``/``/nuts`` deliberately no longer apply
(they are public reads; ``/mcp`` is not), api spec
§1 -- a raw ASGI ``Mount`` can't be reached by FastAPI's ``Depends``, so
that gate is reimplemented as plain ASGI middleware instead) and pairs the
built sub-app with its own ``StreamableHTTPSessionManager`` on ``app.state``
at mount time -- see that module's docstring for why a lazy re-read of the
module-level ``mcp`` singleton's session manager would be wrong.

Ported from ``cyrine/catalog-harvester:apps/geoapi/src/geoapi/mcp_server.py``.
That reference exposed five tools against geoapi's PostgreSQL-backed
``catalog_search`` service: ``search_catalog``, ``get_catalog_record``,
``search_nuts_regions``, ``get_layer_geojson``, ``get_nuts_geometry``.

Kept here (re-backed by this service's own modules -- ``catalog.services
.search``, ``catalog.services.aggregations``, ``catalog.services
.stac_build`` -- instead of geoapi's asyncpg pool):

- ``search_catalog`` -- Collection Search (dataset-level) + facet counts.
- ``get_catalog_record`` -- full record for an id, item or collection/bundle.

**Dropped**: ``get_layer_geojson``, the feature-preview tool that fetched a
layer's actual geometries via geoapi's ``feature_service``/``layer_service``
(DuckLake-backed). This service has no DuckLake connection at all -- it is a
DB-less mirror of the published catalog (see ``catalog.store``) -- so serving
individual feature geometries is out of scope here. ``search_nuts_regions``
and ``get_nuts_geometry`` are also not ported in this pass: the brief for
this port scopes the kept tools to the catalog-search/get-item surface
backed by ``catalog.services.search``/``aggregations``/``stac_build``; NUTS
lookup (``catalog.routers.nuts``, Task 10) is a separate HTTP-only surface
for now and can be added as MCP tools in a follow-up if useful.

Wiring / store access
----------------------
The reference geoapi ``mcp_server`` reached its data through a *module-level*
asyncpg pool (``layer_service._pool``) rather than through FastAPI's request-
scoped DI, because the Streamable HTTP transport is a separately-mounted
Starlette ASGI app (``mcp.streamable_http_app()``): a tool call's request
scope belongs to that sub-app, not to the outer FastAPI app, so there is no
``Request`` object here to depend-inject ``catalog.deps.get_store`` from.

This module follows the same shape: a module-level ``_store`` accessor, set
once by ``catalog.app``'s lifespan (via ``set_store``) right after it builds
the app's ``CatalogStore``, and read by every tool call via
``_require_store()``. This mirrors ``CatalogStore`` itself (already a
per-process singleton hung off ``app.state``) and is fine for the single
running app per process this service is deployed as; it is *not* safe for
two ``CatalogStore``s to be live concurrently in the same interpreter (e.g.
two ``TestClient``s open at once against apps built by two concurrent
``create_app()`` calls) -- tests must not overlap two open MCP-enabled
clients.

Result-size caps
-----------------
``_MAX_RESULT_ITEMS``/``_MAX_RESULT_BYTES`` mirror the reference's
``_MAX_GEOJSON_FEATURES``/``_MAX_GEOJSON_BYTES`` (5000 features / ~450 KB),
sized there to stay under the MCP transport's ~1 MB tool-result limit even
if a client double-counts (structured + text echo). The reference only
needed this for the (dropped) per-feature GeoJSON tool; kept here as a
general safety net applied to every list-shaped tool result (``search_catalog``
results, a bundle's member items in ``get_catalog_record``), since a facet-
heavy or member-heavy catalog could in principle still produce a large body.

Error handling
--------------
Unlike the reference (which ``raise``s ``ValueError`` for an unknown id, relying
on the MCP dispatch layer -- ``MCPServer._handle_call_tool`` -- to catch it and
convert it to an error ``CallToolResult``), these tool functions return a
``{"error": "..."}`` dict on a lookup failure instead of raising. They are
plain, directly-callable coroutines (``@mcp.tool()`` returns the undecorated
function -- see ``MCPServer.tool``'s implementation), and this project's unit
tests call them directly rather than through the MCP protocol, so a clean
error payload is preferable to an exception that only the protocol layer
would otherwise catch.
