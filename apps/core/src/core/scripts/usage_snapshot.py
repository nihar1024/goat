"""GOAT Usage snapshot — gauge emitter for the "GOAT - Usage" Grafana dashboard.

Runs as a Kubernetes CronJob (every 5 min), queries GOAT's Postgres via the
existing async session manager, and pushes a fixed set of OTel gauges through
the alloy-receiver OTLP endpoint that goatobs already speaks to. Each gauge
maps 1:1 to a panel in ``argocd/apps/o11y/grafana/dashboards/goat-usage.json``.

Invocation::

    python -m core.scripts.usage_snapshot

Env vars consumed (via ``goatobs.setup_observability`` and ``settings``):

* ``OTEL_ENABLED`` -- must be ``true`` for any metric to be exported.
* ``ENVIRONMENT`` -- ``dev`` / ``prod`` etc, used as ``deployment.environment``.
* ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` -- gRPC endpoint of the local Alloy receiver.
* GOAT Postgres connection vars (``POSTGRES_*`` -> ``ASYNC_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI``).

Exit codes:

* ``0`` -- every query succeeded; ``goat_usage_snapshot_last_success_timestamp_seconds``
  was advanced.
* ``1`` -- at least one query failed; the gauges for failed queries keep their
  previous value in Mimir, ``goat_usage_snapshot_query_errors_total{query_name=...}``
  was incremented, and Kubernetes records the CronJob run as failed.

Each query runs in its own ``try/except`` so one broken query does not prevent
the rest from publishing.

# would have the dashboard's Organization dropdown collapse colliding
# orgs into one entry that filters to BOTH.
#
# Strategy: suffix the name ONLY when it collides, using the owner's
# full email as the human-readable disambiguator. The owner is the
# user with the `organization-owner` role (see accounts/src/db/seed_roles.py)
# whose own `organization_id` points at this org. If the org has
# multiple owners we pick MIN(email) deterministically; if it has zero
# owners we fall back to an 8-char UUID prefix. Output shape:

    # TODO(usage-snapshot): Windmill cross-DB metrics. The dashboard expects
    # counter-typed series goat_jobs_total / goat_jobs_duration_seconds_total /
    # goat_jobs_output_bytes_total (labels: org_id, org_name, tool, status) plus
    # a goat_jobs_running gauge. Source tables in the Windmill Postgres DB:
    #   - `completed_job` (a.k.a. history of finished runs) -- has columns
    #     `started_at`, `duration_ms`, `success`, `canceled`, `created_by`,
    #     `script_path`, `result` (JSONB; output-bytes lives here if at all).
    #     This is the source for the *_total counters.
    #   - `queue` -- currently-queued/running jobs; source for goat_jobs_running.
    #   - There may also be a `job` view that unions both -- prefer the
    #     explicit tables for predictable behaviour.
    # Implementation notes:
    #   1. A second async engine pointed at the Windmill Postgres -- same
    #      cluster as GOAT but different database (`windmill`), so the URL
    #      is the same host:port but `?database=windmill`.
    #   2. Use ObservableCounter so the OTel SDK emits a cumulative absolute
    #      value (queried from `completed_job` at observation time) rather
    #      than per-run deltas -- otherwise each fresh CronJob process looks
    #      like a counter reset to Prometheus and rate()/increase() misbehave.
    #      The ObservableCounter callback can run sync against a tiny psycopg
    #      connection -- no need to drag asyncio through the callback.
    #   3. `tool` label: map from Windmill's `script_path` (e.g.
    #      "f/goat/buffer") to the dashboard's tool taxonomy.
    #   4. `org_id` / `org_name` label: join `completed_job.created_by`
    #      against GOAT's `accounts.user` to find the user's organization.
    #      This means the Windmill DB connection alone isn't sufficient --
    #      the script needs both DBs visible. Tracked in spec section 4.3.
