"""DuckLake manager instance for Processes API.

Creates a read-only singleton instance of BaseDuckLakeManager from goatlib.
Processes API only reads data for sync analytics - all writes happen through the core app.

# Singleton instance for analytics queries (histogram, aggregation-stats, etc.)
# This allows processes and core to run concurrently without lock conflicts
ducklake_manager = BaseDuckLakeManager(read_only=True)

# Separate singleton for preview-sql queries.
# preview_sql runs arbitrary user SQL of unknown duration, so it must not share
# the analytics lock — a slow or complex query would block all other analytics.
