// One marching-squares contour band. Each feature carries:
//   origin_idx — index into the request's starting points, distinguishing
//                features for shape_style=separated;
//   cluster_idx — index of the spatial cluster within that origin's field.
//                Combined catchments with widely-spread origins decompose
//                into multiple disjoint clusters so each per-cluster grid
//                stays bounded by the catchment radius. The cluster index
//                must be carried through SQL band-difference JOINs so a
//                step_cost in cluster A is differenced against the same
//                cluster's previous step, not another cluster's.
