"""A bounded sample of an item's data, read straight from the catalog bucket.

The catalog serves metadata; this is the one endpoint that touches the data
itself, so that a detail page can show *what the dataset looks like* rather
than only what it claims to be -- the map preview a Carto-style catalog page
is built around.

Three decisions shape it, each measured against the real bucket rather than
assumed:

**A fixed sample, not a viewport.** No ``bbox`` parameter, no refetch on pan or
zoom. That keeps the response a pure function of (item, mirror generation), so
it is cached and computed at most once per item per harvest -- which is also
what makes reading on demand strictly better than publishing 10,793 preview
files, most of which nobody would ever open.

**The cap is bytes, not features.** Per-feature GeoJSON across the live catalog
spans 0.07-66.7 KB -- a ~950x range that file size does not predict (the worst
offender is a 1.4 MB file; a 447 MB one is 9x cheaper per feature). 100 raw
features of one dataset came to 6.4 MB. So the feature ceiling is a fallback
and the byte budget is the real limit.

**Simplification does the work.** At a tolerance of "one screen pixel" the same
100 features came to 0.27 MB -- 24x smaller, and faster, with nothing visible
lost at the zoom the extent is drawn at.

Cost, measured cold with no cache against Hetzner: 0.08 s on a typical file,
1.3-2.9 s on the largest (447 MB / 496k rows). Only the first viewer of an item
pays it.

    deleted. A preview can never outlive the mirror it was sampled under.

    Note the residual: if the harvester rewrites ``data/<id>.parquet`` without
