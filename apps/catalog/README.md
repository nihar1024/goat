# GOAT Catalog API

STAC API implementation for the GOAT data catalog.

## Overview

This service serves the harvested GOAT data catalog as a [STAC API](https://stacspec.org/) (v1.0.0: Core, Collections, OGC API - Features, Item Search; extensions: Filter/CQL2, Free-text, Sort, Collection Search, Aggregation), plus GOAT-specific helpers and an MCP server for LLM clients.

It is **database-less by design**. The whole catalog lives in four files under `${DATA_DIR}/catalog`:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `mirror_items.parquet` | One row per STAC Item |
| `mirror_collections.parquet` | One row per Collection |
| `nuts.parquet` | NUTS regions, for the spatial-filter region search |
| `VERSION` | Marker identifying the loaded generation |

The two mirror files are maintained by the goatlib `sync_catalog` task (S3 → local, ETag-gated, atomic swap with `VERSION` written last); `nuts.parquet` has its own producer, `sync_nuts` (built from Eurostat). The service watches the files and reloads automatically when they change, without interrupting in-flight requests.

Items and collections are exposed as DuckDB **views** over the parquet files rather than resident tables, so a query reads only the columns it projects and a file swap costs no extra copy of the data. There is no full-text index — free-text search scans the mirror's precomputed `search_text` column. NUTS is small, so it is materialized as a table.

## Why a Separate Service?

Same rationale as the geoapi/processes split: catalog browse/search traffic and MCP sessions from LLM clients must never contend with the latency-critical tile path. Because the service needs no database and no object storage at request time, it scales by simply running more replicas against the same read-only files.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /stac` | Landing page (Catalog + `conformsTo`) |
| `GET /stac/conformance` | Conformance classes |
| `GET /stac/queryables` · `GET /stac/collections/{cid}/queryables` | CQL2 filterable properties |
| `GET /stac/collections` | Dataset collections (Collection Search params) |
| `GET /stac/collections/{cid}` · `/items` · `/items/{itemId}` | Collection browse (OGC API - Features) |
| `GET`/`POST /stac/search` | Item Search (bbox, intersects, ids, datetime, CQL2 `filter`, free-text `q`, `sortby`, facet params) |
| `GET /stac/aggregations` · `GET /stac/aggregate` | Aggregation extension (facet discovery + counts) |
| `GET /stac/resolve/{id}` · `GET /stac/items/{id}` | GOAT extensions: id resolution / collection-agnostic item lookup |
| `GET /stac/items/{id}/preview` | GOAT extension: bounded GeoJSON sample of an item's data |
| `GET /stac/nuts` · `GET /stac/nuts/{id}/geometry` | NUTS region typeahead + boundary (spatial-filter UI) |
| `GET`/`POST /mcp` | MCP server (Streamable HTTP): `search_catalog`, `describe_catalog`, `suggest_terms`, `get_catalog_record` |
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness + loaded catalog version and item/collection counts |
| `GET /api/docs` · `/api/redoc` · `/api/openapi.json` | Interactive API docs + OpenAPI schema (same layout as geoapi/processes) |

`GET /stac` responses carry an `ETag` and a short `Cache-Control`, so conditional requests answer `304` while a generation is unchanged.

Auth follows the repo-wide `AUTH` switch (JWT via Keycloak when enabled). `/stac` reads are **public**: no credentials means anonymous, but an invalid or expired token is a `401` rather than a silent downgrade. `/mcp` always requires credentials when auth is on.

## Running Locally

```bash
# Needs a catalog mirror. Generate a synthetic one for development:
cd apps/catalog
uv run python -c "
from pathlib import Path; import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'tests')
from fixtures.gen_catalog import write_catalog, write_nuts
d = Path('/tmp/goat-catalog-dev/catalog'); d.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
write_catalog(d, n=1000); write_nuts(d)"

DATA_DIR=/tmp/goat-catalog-dev AUTH=False uv run uvicorn catalog.main:app --reload --port 8400
curl localhost:8400/stac | jq .

# Tests
uv run pytest tests/
```

## Configuration

Env prefix `CATALOG_`; shared values (`AUTH`, `DATA_DIR`, `KEYCLOAK_SERVER_URL`, `REALM_NAME`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `S3_*`) are read from their repo-wide names with `CATALOG_`-prefixed overrides. Notable settings:

- `CATALOG_ENABLE_MCP` (default true) and `CATALOG_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (default `["*"]`; set the real ingress hostname in production — it is the DNS-rebinding check for the `/mcp` transport).
- `CATALOG_DUCKDB_TEMP_DIR` (spill target — keeps a heavy concurrent moment a slow query instead of an out-of-memory error), plus optional `CATALOG_DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT` / `CATALOG_DUCKDB_THREADS` to keep peak usage under a container limit.
- Previews are the one thing this service reads remotely, and need `S3_CATALOG_BUCKET` plus S3 credentials; without them `/stac/items/{id}/preview` returns 404. `CATALOG_PREVIEW_CACHE_DIR` is unset by default (no server-side cache — clients cache on the ETag instead).
- `CORS_ORIGINS` defaults to the GOAT web app's own origin rather than `*`. This only constrains browsers; QGIS, pystac-client and other STAC tooling are unaffected.
