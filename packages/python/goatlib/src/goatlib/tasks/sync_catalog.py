"""Build the local catalog mirror from the published stac-geoparquet.

This is the consumer side of the mirror described in
`docs/goat-catalog-design.md` §5: `apps/catalog` serves STAC search off
DuckDB-readable parquet on the shared data volume, and this task is what keeps
those files current. It does *not* touch Postgres and does not upsert rows
anywhere — the catalog is two files, swapped atomically.

(NUTS, the other file the service reads, has its own producer:
`goatlib.tasks.sync_nuts` builds it from Eurostat, not from this bucket.)

The bucket publishes **native stac-geoparquet**: ``items.parquet`` (one row per
STAC Item) and ``collections.parquet`` (one row per Collection). It does *not*
publish the query-shaped mirror `apps/catalog` serves; that shape is built
here, by `goatlib.tasks.catalog_mirror`, so every derived column
(``search_text``, the bundle precomputation, the envelope doubles) stays ours
to change without a harvester contract negotiation.

Algorithm:
    1. ``head_object`` both published keys to read their ETags.
    2. Compare a composite of the two against the local ``VERSION`` marker
       (written by the previous successful sync). Equal ⇒ nothing to do, no
       download: a change to *either* published file must trigger a rebuild,
       so the marker has to cover both.
    3. Otherwise download both, run ``build_mirror`` into two ``.tmp`` files,
       then check each has every column ``apps/catalog`` requires (see
       ``REQUIRED_ITEM_COLUMNS`` / ``REQUIRED_COLLECTION_COLUMNS``) and at
       least one row. A failure here raises, leaving the previous mirror +
       ``VERSION`` untouched — a bad upstream file, or a converter bug, must
       never take the service down.
    4. ``os.replace()`` both validated tmp files over their final paths
       (collections first — see the comment at the call site for the
       microsecond window this leaves and why that ordering is the safer
       one), then write ``VERSION`` (the composite marker) *last*:
       `apps/catalog`'s `CatalogStore.ensure_current()` reloads when the
       marker changes, so writing it last is what bounds a mixed read to the
       gap between the two replaces rather than to the whole build.

If the bucket holds a JSON STAC tree instead of published parquet (no such
keys), this raises ``NotImplementedError``: the JSON-tree → geoparquet
conversion is contract decision C1 in `docs/goat-catalog-contract.md` and is
not built yet, on purpose — do not half-build it here.

Windmill deployment: registered in `goatlib.tasks.registry` as
`f/goat/tasks/sync_catalog` and synced via `scripts/windmill/sync-tools.sh`
(the *tasks* sync path, not the analytics-tools one — same split as every
other module in `goatlib/tasks/`). Worker tag ``"tools"``. No schedule is
hardcoded as a hard requirement of this module; the registry entry sets a
periodic cron (see `goatlib.tasks.registry`), matching the "Windmill cron"
cadence noted in the design doc.
