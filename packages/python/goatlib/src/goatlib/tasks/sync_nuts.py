"""Build the local ``nuts.parquet`` from Eurostat GISCO.

``apps/catalog``'s spatial filter is NUTS-based: ``/stac/nuts`` is a region
typeahead and ``/stac/nuts/{id}/geometry`` returns the boundary the UI draws
and filters with. Both read ``${DATA_DIR}/catalog/nuts.parquet``, and until
this task existed nothing produced that file -- the store fell back to an
empty table, so the endpoints answered ``200 []`` and the spatial filter had
no regions to offer.

**Why not the catalog bucket.** `docs/goat-catalog-design.md` §5 assumed NUTS
would be published alongside the catalog and fetched by the same sync. It is
not, and it should not be: NUTS is public reference data from Eurostat with a
three-year release cycle and no relationship to what the harvester crawls.
Making it a harvester deliverable would couple a GOAT UI feature to another
team's release for data anyone can download. So this is a separate task
against the authoritative source.

Source: the GISCO distribution service, whose files are versioned by
(year, resolution) --
``https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/nuts/geojson/NUTS_RG_<res>_<year>_4326.geojson``.
That pair *is* the version marker: a GISCO release is immutable, so there is
nothing to diff and no ETag to track. Re-running with the same pair is a
no-op unless ``force`` is set.

Resolution: 01M is the most detailed (~67 MB of GeoJSON, ~12 MB as parquet)
and is the default, because the geometry is used to *filter* -- a coarse
boundary quietly changes which datasets a region search returns. Coarser
levels (03M, 10M, 20M, 60M) exist for cheap display and are accepted here.

Windmill deployment: registered in `goatlib.tasks.registry` as
`f/goat/tasks/sync_nuts`, worker tag ``"tools"``, with **no schedule** -- a
67 MB download on a cron for data that changes every three years is waste.
Run it on demand when Eurostat publishes a new release.
