"""Helpers for handling computed columns within feature_write_service.

`parse_computed_columns` turns the layer's `field_config` JSONB blob
into a list of specs (name + dependency-set + compute SQL fragment).
`select_recompute_specs` filters those specs against a set of changed
source columns. `fetch_field_config` reads the JSONB from PG.

This module knows nothing about HTTP. Task D1 wires these helpers into
INSERT/UPDATE statements on customer layer tables.

    also carries a DuckDB ``DEFAULT``, which would cover an INSERT that omitted
