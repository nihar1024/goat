/**
 * A stop on a line (01-editing-operations § 3): 3.2 taken off it, for the
 * trips in scope. The scope is one of three levels, the same for every edit
 * on a line (decided 6 Nov 2026): a variant (one pattern), a direction (its
 * patterns), the whole line; not a trip, which an edit on the map never has
 * picked (9 Nov 2026). The selection sets where it
 * starts; the Apply bar's "Apply to" widens or narrows it, each level with
 * the trips it takes, one that takes none named with why.
 *
 * Taken off: the trips in scope no longer call there; the stop stays, as do
 * the line's paths (the vehicles drive the same streets, 6 Nov 2026), and
 * every other time. The cascade is a stop delete's for those trips
 * (removeStops): patterns without the stop, merged where one runs the same
 * stops, a pattern only some of whose trips are in scope split; refused
 * where a trip would keep fewer than two stops, end untimed, or lose the
 * first stop its frequencies run from.
