# Catalog

The Data Catalog is your gateway to exploring Plan4Better's comprehensive collection of high-quality [geospatial datasets](../further_reading/glossary#geospatial-data). **This curated library provides reliable, ready-to-use data from official open-data providers and other trusted sources**, enabling you to immediately start analysis and visualization within your GOAT projects. From the Catalog you can:

- **Explore our dataset collection** spanning multiple thematic areas and geographic regions
- **Search and filter through it** by keyword, spatial extent, and dataset attributes

</div>

## Exploring the Catalog

Access the Data Catalog from the [Workspace](../category/workspace) or directly through the <code>+ Add layer</code> button in your GOAT projects. The catalog provides powerful discovery tools including:

- **Keyword search** for finding specific datasets or topics
- **Filters** to browse datasets by Type, Data Category, Region, Language, Distributor Name, and Licence
- **Interactive preview** to assess data quality and content before use

### Dataset Category {#dataset-category}

**One way of filtering the Catalog is through Data Category**, which organizes datasets into clear thematic categories for easy navigation:

- **Boundary** - Administrative, political, and geographic boundaries including borders and districts
- **Land-use** - Classifications of land areas by usage type (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.)
- **People** - Demographic data including population density, age groups, and socio-economic characteristics
- **Places** - Points of interest such as schools, hospitals, tourist attractions, and services
- **Transportation** - Road networks, railways, airports, ports, and public transport infrastructure

### Dataset Metadata

Each dataset includes comprehensive metadata accessible by clicking on the dataset name. The metadata view provides:

- **Detailed descriptions** explaining dataset content and scope
- **Dataset type** classification and technical specifications
- **Geographic coverage** with **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** country codes
- **Source information** including distributor name and contact details
- **License details** specifying usage rights and restrictions
- **Interactive map preview** for visual data exploration
- **Attribute information** showing available data fields and properties

### Available Dataset Types

**The catalog includes diverse datasets** managed as feature layers containing geospatial features (points, lines, polygons) or non-geospatial tabular data. 

#### Points of Interest (POIs)
**Strategic locations of amenities, facilities, and attractions essential for accessibility planning and urban analysis**, such as Public transport stops and stations, Shopping centers and retail locations, Tourism and leisure facilities, Food and beverage establishments, Healthcare facilities and hospitals, Educational institutions and schools.

*Data Sources:* [Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/), [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/), government departments, health insurance providers, and retail companies. Additional field data collection conducted when necessary.

#### Population and Buildings
**Detailed demographic data disaggregated to building and local levels**, enhanced with land-use information for improved accuracy. We provide Building-level population data for German districts and municipalities, local population data from German Census 2022, and European NUTS-3 level population statistics (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics).

*Data Sources:* [German Census 2022](https://ergebnisse.zensus2022.de/datenbank/online/), individual municipalities and districts, and 3D City Models from German federal states.

#### Administrative Boundaries
**Comprehensive boundary datasets defining governmental and administrative jurisdictions at multiple scales**, such as Municipal boundaries, District boundaries, Federal state boundaries, and Postal code regions.

*Data Sources:* [Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG)](https://www.bkg.bund.de/) and [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).

## Adding Catalog data to your projects

Follow these steps to add datasets from the catalog to your GOAT projects:

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">1</div>
  <div class="content">In your project, navigate to the <strong>Layers</strong> tab and click <code>+ Add Layer</code></div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">2</div>
  <div class="content">Select <code>Catalog Explorer</code> to browse the Data Catalog</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">3</div>
  <div class="content">Browse or search for your desired dataset, then click <code>Add Layer</code> to include it in your project</div>
</div>

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require('/img/workspace/catalog/catalog_add-layer.gif').default} alt="Catalog Explorer" style={{ maxHeight: "700px", maxWidth: "800px"}}/>
</div>

:::tip Hint
After adding the layer, you can apply [Filters](../map/filter.md "Filter dataset")  to constrain large datasets to specific geographic extents or attributes needed for your analysis

## Data quality and maintenance

Plan4Better ensures the reliability and currency of catalog data through comprehensive data management processes:

### Data collection and preparation

Our data collection process follows rigorous standards to ensure quality and reliability:

- **Source identification** - We prioritize official open data portals and publicly available initiatives
- **Format standardization** - Various formats (shapefiles, GeoJSON, etc.) are converted to consistent schemas
- **Data integration** - Multiple datasets are combined and adapted to local contexts through fusion workflows
- **Quality validation** - Comprehensive validation processes ensure accuracy and reliability
- **Continuous expansion** - We actively seek and integrate additional datasets based on user needs

### Update schedule

To maintain data currency and relevance:

- **Annual updates** - All datasets are refreshed at least once per year
- **Dynamic data** - Rapidly changing data (POIs, public transport) receives more frequent updates
- **On-demand updates** - Critical datasets can be updated as needed based on user requirements
