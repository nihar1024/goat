"""DuckLake maintenance task.

DuckLake is snapshot-based: every write (CREATE, DROP, INSERT, layer replace)
creates a new global snapshot, and prior data files remain on disk as long as
ANY snapshot references them. Without periodic maintenance, parquet files
accumulate (verified empirically: 12k+ snapshots, 11k+ parquets in dev over
5 months).

This task runs the canonical DuckLake maintenance flow:
    1. ``ducklake_expire_snapshots`` — removes snapshots older than the
       retention window from the catalog. After this, time-travel queries
       (``AS OF VERSION N``) for those snapshots stop working, but only
       the catalog state changes — no parquet files are deleted yet.
    2. ``ducklake_cleanup_old_files`` — deletes parquet files that are
       no longer referenced by any retained snapshot.
    3. Prune ``ducklake_schema_versions`` — ``ducklake_expire_snapshots``
       never deletes rows from this table (verified on catalog formats 0.3
       and 1.0), so per-table schema-version history accumulates forever:
       at 12k tables that is thousands of unreachable rows per
       schema-changing day. A row applies from its ``begin_snapshot`` until
       the table's next row, so any row older than the table's newest row
       at-or-before the oldest live snapshot can never be resolved by any
       query — those are deleted directly in the Postgres catalog.

Key safety property (worth re-stating because the global retention scares
people the first time): expire + cleanup NEVER deletes the active data of a
live (untouched) layer. A snapshot is a cumulative catalog view, not a diff
— every snapshot from a layer's creation onward references that layer's
current parquet, so the file stays referenced until the layer is explicitly
dropped or replaced. Only superseded versions (from layer_replace /
layer_update) and dropped-layer remnants become orphan-eligible.
