"""A project-child id is only ever resolved inside the project in its path (S3).

`layer_project` ids come from one global sequence and `auth_z` only checks the
caller's role on the `{project_id}` in the path, so a route that fetched the
child by its own id alone let anyone who owns any project read, restyle and
delete another tenant's project-layer link. Every such route now looks the
child up by both ids, so a foreign id is simply not found.
