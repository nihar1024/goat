 * The job tray labels a job with `t(job.processID)`, so a process id with no
 * key renders as the raw id — "catalog_materialize - 07:17 PM". Every id a job
 * can carry therefore needs a label in both languages.
 *
 * The list is written out rather than derived: it is the contract between the
 * Python tool registry and these files, and a test here cannot read that.
