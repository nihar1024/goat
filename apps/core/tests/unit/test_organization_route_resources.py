"""Every organization-scoped route resolves to a seeded authz resource.

``auth_z`` looks the request up by the pattern ``route_pattern`` rebuilds,
and a pattern no seeded resource matches answers 401 for everyone. A router
mounted under a prefix that itself holds a placeholder
(``/organizations/{organization_id}/domains``) produced such a pattern: the
prefix is copied from the concrete request path, so the organization id
ended up in the pattern as a literal value.
