"""Batch edits to a bundle's editable member layer.

One request, one transaction, because the edges layer and the nodes layer only
make sense together: the edge query in the artifact build inner-joins them, so an
edge naming a node that was never written is dropped and the street silently
disappears from routing.

The client draws edges. Everything about the nodes layer is decided here —
reuse a node within tolerance, split the edge the endpoint landed on, or mint a
node — so a user never has to keep source_node and target_node honest by hand.
