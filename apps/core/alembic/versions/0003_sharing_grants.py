"""Sharing collapses onto resource_grant; restricted content; shareable layers.

What an `init`-era database gains here:

* `resource_grant.granted_by` becomes nullable and its foreign key becomes
  `ON DELETE SET NULL`. Deleting a user used to cascade-delete every grant
  they had created, revoking access to content that still exists;
* the rows of the six legacy share-link tables (`layer_user`, `layer_team`,
  `layer_organization`, `project_user`, `project_team`,
  `project_organization`) as `resource_grant` rows, so that ONE rule
  (`customer.effective_role`) answers access questions for every resource
  kind — and then the six tables and the sharing trigger functions are
  dropped. Owner rows (roles ending in `-owner`, written by triggers) are not
  grants: ownership stays the `user_id` column and is not copied;
* `restricted` on folder, project, layer and bundle, marking content that its
  space's members do not reach through the space default role, and
  `shareable` on `layer_project`, marking whether a layer travels with the
  project when the project is shared. Both default to the pre-existing
  behaviour, so no backfill is needed.

The authz SQL functions that read `resource_grant` instead of these tables
(`effective_role`, `layer_write_allowed`, `check_layer`, `check_project`) are
installed by `0005_home_templates`, the head of the chain: their bodies read
`layer.space_id`, `folder.parent_id`, the `restricted` columns and
`customer.template`, none of which exist yet at this point. `env.py` wraps the
whole upgrade in one transaction, so no session ever sees these tables gone
while the old function bodies are still in place; without that install, a pod
still on the old bodies would get `relation does not exist` on every request
between the commit and the next `initial_data` run.

A fresh database is built by `init` from the current models: it has none of
the legacy tables, so the copy, the verification and the drops are all
skipped, and the columns are already there. The revision passes through
unchanged.
