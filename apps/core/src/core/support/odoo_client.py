"""The support bridge's Odoo client: core.odoo's client with the bridge's
allow-list, and Odoo's errors as support errors.

The bridge's Odoo rights are already narrow; ALLOWED_CALLS keeps a bug in
GOAT from turning into "any call on any model" as well. OdooUnavailable
becomes SupportUnavailable (503); a 4xx becomes this module's OdooRejected,
which is both a SupportRejected and a core.odoo OdooRejected.
