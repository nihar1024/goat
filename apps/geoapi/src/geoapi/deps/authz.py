"""Read authorization dependencies for tile/feature/metadata endpoints.

Flagged behind ``Settings.ENFORCE_READ_AUTHZ`` (default False = shadow
mode): a denied read is only logged as ``read_authz.would_deny`` — the
counter to watch on dev before flipping the flag — never blocked, until
enforcement is turned on. A service-call error is handled the same way:
logged as ``read_authz.error`` and treated as allowed in shadow mode, but
treated as a denial (403) once enforcement is on — fail closed, never a 500.

``require_layer_read`` takes the route's ``collectionId`` path parameter
directly (not ``LayerInfoDep``) so that routes with a documented
no-DuckLake-lookup fast path — ``get_tile`` in particular — never pay for a
layer_info resolution just to run this check. It NEVER bypasses the check;
it is attached to all layer-serving routes except ``get_features``.

``require_layer_read_unless_temp`` is the one exception, attached ONLY to
``get_features``: it bypasses the check for that route's own ``?temp=true``
branch. Temp layers are per-user scratch parquet files —
``feature_service.get_temp_features`` only ever globs
``user_{user_id}/**/t_{layer_uuid}.parquet`` under the *requesting* user's
own temp directory, never a ``customer.layer``-backed table — so they carry
no grants and there is nothing to check. This bypass must not be attached
to any other route: none of the other six routes' handlers have a temp
branch, so a `?temp=true` there would (before this fix, did) skip the check
while still serving the real, `customer.layer`-backed data.

The one authorization rule lives in Postgres (``customer.can``), so every
check is a round trip. A short in-process TTL cache below bounds that cost:
one map pan (~50 tile requests) costs one ``customer.can`` query per
(layer, user) instead of fifty. The trade-off is that a revoked share can
still read for up to ``READ_AUTHZ_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`` after being revoked.
