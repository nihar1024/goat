    #: limit alongside DuckDB's working set, and on local disk it consumes
    #: ephemeral storage, which is what gets pods evicted when a node fills.

    #: Set it to enable caching -- ideally a writable shared volume, so one
    #: render serves every replica. The mirror volume cannot be it (mounted
