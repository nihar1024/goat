"""Bearer-JWT auth dependency for the ``/stac`` router.

Mirrors geoapi's Keycloak-token validation
(``apps/geoapi/src/geoapi/deps/auth.py``) via the same shared
``goatlib.auth.KeycloakAuth``, gated by ``CatalogSettings.auth`` -- the
repo-wide ``AUTH`` env var (see ``catalog.config``). The catalog API returns
no per-user data (api spec §1), so this dependency only ever needs to answer
"is there a valid token", never who the caller is.

``validate_token`` is the seam tests monkeypatch to exercise the
401-without-token path under ``AUTH=True`` without touching a real Keycloak
server (constructing ``KeycloakAuth`` with ``verify_signature=True`` fetches
its public key over the network on first use).

    The catalog's metadata is public (design S1/S14) -- the GOAT UI's catalog
    page is served on a public route and embedded off-site, so its visitors
    carry no token and every read must work without one. This deliberately
    does **not** simply skip validation: a request that presents a token is
    making a claim about who it is, and honouring a malformed or expired one
    by silently degrading to anonymous would turn "your token expired" into
    "you quietly see less", and would let a broken client believe it is
    authenticated. So: no credentials -> anonymous; valid credentials -> fine;
    invalid credentials -> 401.

    Nothing here grants anything *extra* to an authenticated caller yet; the
    validation exists so that when org-restricted entries and signed asset
    access arrive (design §10), identity is already trustworthy at this seam.

    Reads the ``Authorization`` header directly instead of depending on
    ``oauth2_scheme``: that dependency would register an OpenAPI *security
    requirement* on every route using it, so Swagger would draw a padlock on
    all 16 public read endpoints and tell readers they need credentials they
    do not need. The header parsing is identical either way -- only the
    generated documentation differs.
