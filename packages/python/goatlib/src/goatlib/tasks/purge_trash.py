"""Purge trashed content past its retention period.

Soft-deleted rows (``deleted_at`` set by core's delete endpoints) stay
restorable for `retention_days`. This task removes what has aged out for
good: DuckLake tables first, so a failed data delete never leaves an
orphaned table behind a vanished metadata row, then the row itself and its
``resource_grant`` rows. Children go before parents — layers, templates,
projects and bundles are purged before folders, and a folder is only removed
once every live or still-trashed child inside it is gone (a folder with a
lingering child is simply skipped and picked up on a later run once that
child has been purged).
