# Kubernetes (Helm)

GOAT has a Helm chart for Kubernetes clusters, published at `oci://ghcr.io/plan4better/charts/goat`. This page summarises what the chart includes and what you have to provide. The [chart README](https://github.com/plan4better/goat/tree/main/deploy/helm/goat) is the full reference for all values.

:::tip One server? Use Docker Compose
For a single server, the [Docker Compose bundle](./docker_compose/installation.md) is the recommended path. It includes the login server, object storage and HTTPS, which the Helm chart leaves to you.
:::

This page describes chart version **0.6.0**, which installs GOAT **v3.0.3** by default.

## Install {#install}

```bash
helm install goat oci://ghcr.io/plan4better/charts/goat \
  --version 0.6.0 \
  --namespace goat --create-namespace \
  --values your-values.yaml \
  --wait --timeout 25m
```

A first install pulls several large images, which is why the timeout is long. A fresh cluster needs this one command only.

## What the chart includes {#included}

| Component | Default |
|---|---|
| core, web, geoapi, processes, catalog | on |
| Windmill server and the default worker | on |
| Windmill workers `tools`, `workflows` and `print` | **off** |
| PostgreSQL through CloudNativePG (operator and cluster) | on, optional sub-chart |
| Redis | on, optional |
| A shared data volume (`data`, 200 Gi, `ReadWriteOnce`) | on |
| Caddy for custom domains | off |

The chart does **not** include:

- **Object storage.** GOAT needs an external S3-compatible storage.
- **Keycloak.** If users should log in, you need an external Keycloak.

You can also point the chart at an existing PostgreSQL or Redis instead of the bundled ones; the chart README lists the SQL your PostgreSQL needs.

## What you have to set {#required-values}

### Public URLs {#public-urls}

The browser calls core, geoapi, processes and catalog directly, so the web app needs their public addresses. Give each service an Ingress with a host (`<service>.ingress.*`), and the URLs are derived from it, or set them explicitly in `web.publicUrls.api`, `.geoapi`, `.processes` and `.catalog`.

:::warning
Without these URLs, the web app shows a blank page.
:::

### Object storage {#storage}

Describe your S3 store once in `global.s3`: the bucket for uploads, the provider, endpoint, region and whether it needs path-style URLs, and a Secret with the access key pair (`global.s3.existingSecret`). Core, geoapi, processes and the analysis workers (below) all get these settings.

Uploaded images, such as project and dataset thumbnails, avatars and dashboard images, go to a second bucket in the same store (`global.s3.assets.bucket`). Browsers load them straight from that bucket, so make it publicly readable and set its public URL in `global.s3.assets.publicUrl`. Outside AWS the URL is required. GOAT's own artwork ships in the web app and needs neither.

### Login {#auth}

Login is **off** by default (`global.auth.enabled: false`): every service then acts as one default user, so put such an installation behind your own access control. To switch login on, set `global.auth.enabled: true` and `global.auth.existingSecret` to a Secret with the keys `server-url`, `realm`, `client-id`, `client-secret` and `nextauth-secret`. One Secret serves all five services.

### Email and invitations {#email}

- **`email`** sets the SMTP server core sends invitations through, with the password from a Secret (`email.existingSecret`). The links in these emails are built from the public web and API URLs.
- **Keycloak** sends its own emails, such as password resets, with the SMTP settings of its realm. Configure the same server there.
- **`global.auth.provisionInvitedUsers: true`** lets an invitation create the Keycloak account, and Keycloak emails a link to set the password. Use it when your realm has self-registration off. Core's Keycloak client then needs the realm-management roles `view-users` and `manage-users`.
- **`global.caBundle`** names a ConfigMap or Secret with a company CA certificate, for an SMTP relay, a Keycloak or pages the print worker opens that use a certificate from a private CA. The chart mounts it into core, web and the `print`, `tools` and `workflows` workers.

### Support tickets {#support}

Optional and **off by default**. Support tickets hand problem reports from your users to an Odoo Helpdesk. The block `odoo` holds the connection (`odoo.url`, `odoo.db`), `odoo.support` the Helpdesk team (`odoo.support.teamId`) and the API key from a Secret (`odoo.support.existingSecret`). Tickets are on only when all of these are set. The key is issued by Plan4Better for its own Odoo, so leave the block empty on your own installation unless you have received one.

Without tickets, *Report a problem* opens an email to the address in `web.supportEmail`, which is also named in the message shown when support is temporarily unavailable. It defaults to `support@plan4better.de`; set your own address for a white-label installation.

Ticket messages can carry attachments of up to 55 MiB in one request. The Ingress in front of core must accept bodies of at least 56 MB on `/api/v2/support` and allow generous read timeouts. ingress-nginx limits bodies to 1 MB by default; raise it with `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "56m"` and `proxy-read-timeout` in `core.ingress.annotations`.

### Analysis workers {#workers}

The default Windmill worker only handles small jobs. **Analysis tools, dataset imports and workflows need the `tools` and `workflows` workers, and PDF printing needs the `print` worker.** All three are off by default. To use them:

- Enable them with `windmill.workers.tools.enabled`, `windmill.workers.workflows.enabled` and `windmill.workers.print.enabled`.
- The `tools` and `workflows` workers are pinned to nodes labelled `node.kubernetes.io/server-usage: geodata` with the toleration `geodata=true:NoSchedule`. Prepare such nodes, or override `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` for these workers. Otherwise their pods stay `Pending` and `helm install --wait` times out.
- The chart gives these workers what GOAT's jobs need: the GOAT database, the S3 store, the catalog bucket, the address of the web app for printing and, with login on, the Keycloak client the print worker signs in with. Windmill passes only the variables listed in `WHITELIST_ENVS` on to the jobs; the chart builds that list, including every variable you add to a worker's `config` or `extraEnv`.
- Enable `windmill.scriptSync.enabled` to register GOAT's analysis tools and tasks in Windmill after the install. It is off by default.

### Storage for several nodes {#rwx}

The shared data volume defaults to `ReadWriteOnce`, which works on a single node. On a cluster with several nodes, set `data.accessMode: ReadWriteMany` with an RWX-capable storage class (`data.storageClassName`), or supply your own claim with `data.existingClaim`.

## Further reading {#further-reading}

The [chart README](https://github.com/plan4better/goat/tree/main/deploy/helm/goat) covers the details: bootstrapping a fresh cluster, the external PostgreSQL setup, authentication precedence, the shared data volume, the region new projects open in (`DEFAULT_PROJECT_VIEW_STATE`), schema migrations and the upgrade notes between chart versions.
