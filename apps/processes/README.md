# GOAT Processes API

OGC API - Processes implementation for GOAT's geospatial analysis tools.

## Overview

This service implements [OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core (OGC 18-062r2)](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-062r2/18-062r2.html). It does three things:

- **Runs analytics tools asynchronously.** An execution request becomes a Windmill job (`f/goat/tools/<tool>`); the client polls `/jobs/{jobId}` for status and the result.
- **Answers short statistics queries synchronously** (feature counts, class breaks, unique values, histograms, layer search, SQL preview). These run in-process against DuckLake and return in the response.
- **Runs and cleans up workflows.** The `/workflows` routes submit a whole workflow graph as one `workflow_runner` job, finalize its temporary results into layers, and read or delete the per-node temporary outputs.

The full, current route list is the OpenAPI document at `/api/docs`.

## Why a Separate Service?

It was split from geoapi so that long-running analysis can never block tile and feature requests. It scales and is resource-limited on its own, and a heavy query here cannot slow down map rendering.

## Where Things Are Defined

| What | Source of truth |
|------|-----------------|
| Async tools (names, categories, beta and hidden flags, worker tag) | `TOOL_REGISTRY` in `packages/python/goatlib/src/goatlib/tools/registry.py` |
| Sync analytics listed by `GET /processes` | `ANALYTICS_DEFINITIONS` in `src/processes/services/analytics_registry.py` |
| Which sync processes are callable without a token | `PUBLIC_ALLOWED_PROCESSES` in `src/processes/routers/processes.py` |
| Settings and their defaults | `src/processes/config.py` |

## Access Rules

- **Async tools always need a user.** The server sets `user_id` in the job inputs from the token, so a client cannot submit a job as someone else.
- **Jobs are private to their owner.** Status, results and dismiss compare the job's `user_id` with the caller and answer 404, not 403, for someone else's job.
- **Everything a request names is checked before it runs** (`src/processes/services/access.py`). Tools and analytics read with service credentials, so they never check the caller themselves. Every layer a request reads must be readable by the caller: in a published project, or allowed by `customer.can`. Every project and folder a tool writes to must be writable, and every bundle readable. A refusal answers 404, like a missing resource; a check that cannot run answers 503. The same rule covers `/workflows/{id}/execute` (dataset nodes and tool configs).
- **A tool's result goes into the folder of the project it runs in**, which belongs to the project's owner. Writing there is allowed to whoever may edit a project the same request names and that lives in that folder, so an editor of a shared project can run tools in it; any other folder needs the caller's own write access.
- **A workflow tool input that an edge feeds is not checked**: the runner replaces it with the upstream node's layer, so whatever id its saved config still holds is never read. The upstream dataset's layer is checked instead.
- **Which inputs name a layer** comes from each tool's schema (`widget="layer-selector"`), plus `EXTRA_LAYER_FIELDS` in `access.py`, plus every key shaped like a layer reference at any depth (`LAYER_KEY_RE`), because the workflow runner folds numbered handles (`input_layer_7_id`, `input_path_3`) and camelCase keys into tool inputs. `tests/test_access.py` fails when a tool gains a layer-shaped field that none of these covers.
- **A layer input must be a layer id** (checked) or a workflow temp-layer id (resolved in the caller's own temp directory). File locations (`*_path`, `*_url` and the like) are filled by the runner; a caller-supplied one is refused, except `wfs_url`. An `s3_key` must be exactly `<bucket path>/users/<caller>/imports/uploads/<file>`, the key core's upload endpoint hands out.
- **A workflow may only name registered tools.** A tool node with any other `processId` is refused before anything runs.
- **User SQL reads its declared inputs and nothing else.** `preview-sql`, `validate-sql`, the `custom_sql` tool and the workflow if node run on a connection with DuckLake attached, so goatlib's validators (`packages/python/goatlib/src/goatlib/utils/sql_validation.py`) allow only the declared aliases and the query's own CTEs, and refuse qualified tables, files, table functions and the file, settings and catalog functions. `preview-sql` resolves a temp-layer id only in the caller's own temp directory.
- **Some sync analytics are public**, so anonymous viewers of a published dashboard get their statistics, for layers of a published project only. `layer-search` and `preview-sql` are allowed anonymously only when scoped to a published project's own layers; `validate-sql` always needs a token.
- **Beta tools** are hidden from `GET /processes` unless the caller's email domain is listed in the Windmill variable named by `BETA_USER_EMAIL_DOMAINS_WM_PATH`.
- With `AUTH=False` every caller is the built-in development user and sees that user's jobs.

## Gotchas

- `preview-sql` and `validate-sql` can be executed but are not in `ANALYTICS_DEFINITIONS`, so `GET /processes` does not list them and `GET /processes/{id}` answers 404.
- `GET /jobs` inlines the full Windmill result of every successful job it returns, and fetches details for export, print and workflow jobs concurrently. Large results make this endpoint memory-heavy.
- `DELETE /jobs/{jobId}` cancels a queued or running job. For a finished job it only answers "dismissed"; nothing is deleted.
- Workflow temporary results live under the hardcoded `/app/data/temporary`, which processes reads directly. The processes container must share `/app/data` with the Windmill workers.
- `TRAVELTIME_MATRICES_DIR` is passed to jobs as a path, so it must be valid on the **worker's** filesystem, not on the processes container.
- `WINDMILL_TOKEN` is read from the process environment, then from the file named by `WINDMILL_TOKEN_FILE`, then from `/app/data/windmill/.token`. A `WINDMILL_TOKEN` line in a `.env` file is not picked up.
- Settings declared with an `os.getenv(...)` default (for example `WINDMILL_URL`, `PROCESSES_DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT`) read that environment name only from the real environment, not from `.env`.
- The default `WINDMILL_URL` (`http://windmill-server:8000`) only resolves inside the compose network. A run on the host must point it at the published Windmill port.

## Development

The service needs Postgres (for the DuckLake catalog) and, with auth on, `KEYCLOAK_SERVER_URL`; it fails at startup otherwise. Load the repo's root `.env` and run it on port 8300, which is what the web app expects:

```bash
set -a && . ./.env && set +a          # from the repo root
cd apps/processes
uv run fastapi dev src/processes/main.py --port 8300

uv run pytest tests/                  # fully mocked, needs no services
ruff check .
```

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t goat-processes -f apps/processes/Dockerfile .   # from the repo root
```

The image runs `fastapi run` on port 8000 as a non-root user, with the DuckDB extensions baked in. It needs the same environment as a local run, plus the shared `/app/data` volume.

`apps/processes/workers/Dockerfile` builds the Windmill server and worker images (`server`, `worker-default`, `worker-tools`, `worker-print`) that execute the jobs this service submits.
