"""Tests for the STAC Aggregation extension (v0.3.0) facet-count layer.

Aggregations must apply the exact same predicates as Item Search (via
``build_filters``), including the blanket exclusion of collection-type rows
-- verified here rather than re-derived, since ``build_filters`` already
owns that rule (see ``catalog.services.search``).
