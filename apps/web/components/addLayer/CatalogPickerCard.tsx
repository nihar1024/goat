 * met; this adds only what picking needs — which layer ids the card stands for, and
 * the tri-state that summarises them.
 *
 * A bundle's layers are fetched only once this card needs them — when it is opened or
 * its checkbox is used. Fetching for every bundle on screen was a request per card
 * and an extra subscription per card, for a checkbox that starts out empty anyway.
 * SWR shares the request with the member list underneath, so opening costs nothing
 * extra once armed.
