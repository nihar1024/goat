# Dataset Types

On GOAT, you can work with datasets from Plan4Better’s catalog, upload your own, or connect to an external service by URL (**WFS**, **WMS**, **WMTS**, **XYZ Tiles** or **COG**). It accepts various formats for both **Feature Datasets** and **[Raster Datasets](https://www.plan4better.de/en/glossary/raster-data)**, as well as [**Street Networks**](#street-networks) and [**Public Transport Networks**](#public-transport-networks). Here we explain the different types of datasets you can use in GOAT.

## Feature Datasets

### 1.1 Spatial Features

Feature datasets store **spatial features like points, lines, or polygons**. On GOAT you can upload data from **Shapefiles**, **Geopackages**, **GeoJSON**, **KML**, **ZIP**, or **Parquet** files, or add a **WFS** external URL. For raster external sources (WMS, WMTS, XYZ Tiles, COG), see [Raster Datasets](#rasters-datasets) below. You can visualize, style, and analyze these datasets using the different tools from the toolbox.

GOAT recognizes two types of feature datasets based on their source:

- **Feature Dataset Standard**: These are the datasets you upload yourself (like GeoJSON, GPKG, KML, and ZIP files), including the layers that arrive with a [Street Network](#street-networks) or a [Public Transport Network](#public-transport-networks). Think of these as your "raw materials" - the original data you bring into GOAT to work with.

- **Feature Dataset Tool**: These are datasets created by GOAT's analysis tools. When you run an analysis (like creating [catchment areas](https://www.plan4better.de/en/glossary/catchment-area) or [heatmaps](https://www.plan4better.de/en/glossary/heatmap)), the results become this type of dataset.

### 1.2 Non-Spatial Datasets

**Tables** are **non-spatial datasets** without geographic reference points, so they can't be visualized on the map. Import them in **CSV** or **XLSX** formats for analysis and data management.

## Street Networks

A **Street Network** is a routable representation of roads, paths and cycleways. GOAT provides a built-in network, and you can import your own whenever you want [routing](https://www.plan4better.de/en/glossary/routing) to run on data you control: a network you maintain yourself, or a planned one you want to test before it is built.

Your data must follow the **[Overture](https://www.plan4better.de/en/glossary/overture-maps)** format, segments and connectors as Parquet files, packed into a `.zip` whose name contains `overture`, for example `overture.zip` or `berlin_overture.zip`. Other street data, including OpenStreetMap, is not supported at the moment.

A street network is made up of two layers that GOAT keeps together:

- **Edges**: the routable segments. This is the layer you edit when you change the network.
- **Nodes**: the points where edges meet. GOAT maintains these for you whenever you save an edge, so the network stays routable.

Street networks power GOAT's [Walking](../routing/walking), [Cycling](../routing/bicycle), [E-bike](../routing/bicycle), and [Car](../routing/car) routing. To import one, see [Adding content](../workspace/content.md#adding-content); for what GOAT's built-in network contains and how to bring your own, see [Network Datasets](./builtin_datasets.md#bringing-your-own-networks).

## Public Transport Networks

A **Public Transport Network** describes the stops, lines and timetables of a transit system. GOAT provides a built-in network, and you can import your own whenever you want to analyse a service you control: your own feed, or a timetable you are planning.

Your data must follow the **[GTFS](https://www.plan4better.de/en/glossary/gtfs)** format, packed into a `.zip` whose name contains `gtfs`, for example `gtfs.zip` or `vbb_gtfs.zip`.

The member layers follow the GTFS feed itself: **Stops**, **Routes**, **Trips** and **Stop times** are always present, and **Agency**, **Calendar** and **Shapes** are added when the feed provides them.

:::info A Public Transport Network needs a Street Network
GOAT connects stops to streets so that it can route the walk to and from a stop. You therefore choose a Street Network while uploading the GTFS file, either GOAT's built-in `Default (Europe)` network or one of your own, which then has to be imported first.
:::

Public transport networks power GOAT's [Public Transport](../routing/public_transport) routing. To import one, see [Adding content](../workspace/content.md#adding-content); for what GOAT's built-in network contains and how to bring your own, see [Network Datasets](./builtin_datasets.md#bringing-your-own-networks).

## Datasets made of several layers

Street Networks and Public Transport Networks are both made up of **several layers that only make sense together**. GOAT calls such a dataset a **bundle** and manages it as a unit: its layers are shared together, they appear together in a project, and deleting the dataset removes all of them.

You will meet the term while working: the upload dialog confirms that a recognized file *will be imported as a bundle*, the [Catalog](../workspace/catalog.md) labels an entry holding several layers `Bundle`, and sharing or deleting one always applies to the whole set.

## Rasters Datasets

Raster datasets can be uploaded directly as **COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF)** files, or connected from external sources via **WMS** (Web Map Service), **WMTS** (Web Map Tile Service), **XYZ Tiles**, or a direct **COG URL** (.tif/.tiff link). They provide georeferenced map images, such as topographic maps, but on GOAT they’re static, so they don’t support analysis or editing.

:::tip Note
Raster styling depends on the external service (e.g., GeoServer). You can’t change the color scheme or feature representation in GOAT.

- **WMS (Web Map Service)**: Supports zooming and panning, ideal for basemaps, but outputs static images and loads slower.

- **WMTS (Web Map Tile Service)**: Uses pre-rendered tiles for fast loading and smooth zooming. Best for large areas and consistent map styles.

- **XYZ Tiles**: Offers fast zooming and panning with tiles defined by X (longitude), Y (latitude), and Z (zoom level) coordinates. Ideal for fast-loading maps with consistent performance at different zoom levels.

|   | WMS | WMTS and XYZ Tiles |
|----|-------------|--------------|
| **Type of URL in GOAT**    | Capabilities URL | Capabilities (only WMTS), Direct URL |
| **Data output** | Dynamic map images | Pre-rendered, cached map tiles |
| **Structure** | No tiles - images generated on-the-fly | Structured tiles based on grid |
| **Performance** | Slower (images generated per request) | Faster (tiles cached) |
| **Customization** | Limited | Limited |
| **Scalability** | Less scalable | Highly scalable |
| **Zoom level** | Variable, set by request parameters | Fixed zoom level, predetermined by server |
