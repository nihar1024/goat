    ``conforms_to`` and ``capability_links`` are passed in rather than built
    here: which extensions this catalog can actually serve is
    ``catalog.services.capabilities``' answer, derived from the loaded file, so
    the page never links a ``queryables`` document for a catalog with nothing

    ``service-doc``: that rel points at a human-readable rendering of the API,

    docs. stac-api-validator warns about its absence; the warning is accepted.
