# Settings

In the Settings section, **you can configure the map controls, branding, social sharing, and interaction behaviour of your dashboard**. When you disable a functionality, it will not be available in Viewer mode.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require('/img/builder/interface_settings.webp').default} alt="Dashboard Settings in GOAT" style={{ maxHeight: "auto", maxWidth: "auto", objectFit: "cover"}}/>
</div>

## Map

- `Toolbar` — shows the top bar with the GOAT logo, project name, last saved timestamp, and project info in Viewer mode.
- `Scalebar` — shows a scale on the map for measuring distances from one point to another.

### Control layout

Controls the position of map controls in Viewer mode. Three positions are available: **Top-left**, **Top-right**, and **Bottom-right**. For each position, click `+` to add a control, drag chips to reorder them, and click `×` on a chip to remove it.

Available controls:

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| `Location search` | Search bar to jump to a location on the map |
| `Measure` | Tool to measure distances and areas on the map |
| `Zoom controls` | Zoom in / zoom out buttons |
| `Basemap switcher` | Dropdown to switch the background map |
| `Fullscreen` | Toggle fullscreen mode |
| `Find my location` | Center the map on the viewer's current location |
| `Project info` | Show the project info panel |

### Allowed basemaps

Restrict which basemaps viewers can switch to. Select one or more basemaps from the dropdown — viewers will only see the ones you enable here. Only shown when `Basemap switcher` is placed in any position.

### Zoom limits

Limit how far dashboard viewers can zoom in and out. A range slider lets you set the minimum and maximum zoom level (0–22). The current map zoom is shown as a marker on the slider for reference.

## Branding

Customize the visual identity of your dashboard for Viewer mode.

- `Font` — select a typeface from the dropdown. Choose `Custom…` to enter a **Font file URL** and **Font Family** name for a custom typeface.
- `Primary Color` — set the main accent color used for buttons and highlights.
- `Icon Color` — set the color for icons throughout the dashboard.
- `Font Color` — set the text color used across the dashboard.
- `Favicon` — upload a custom browser tab icon. Click `×` to remove it.

---

## Social sharing

Customize how your dashboard appears when shared via social media or messaging apps.

- **Preview image** — drag and drop or click to upload an image (recommended: 1200×630 pixels). Falls back to the default GOAT preview when unset.
- **Description** — add a short description (up to 300 characters) used in social previews and search results.

---

## General

- `Language` — set the dashboard display language. Options: `Auto (Browser Default)`, `English`, `Deutsch`.

## Interactions

Interactions link dashboard elements together, so that one action by the viewer automatically triggers a matching change in another element. For example, activating a layer group can switch the active tab in a widget, or toggling one layer's visibility can show and hide related layers.

Click `Manage Interactions` to open the interactions editor. Each interaction is a rule made of a **trigger** (`When` something happens) and an **action** (what happens in response). Click `Add Interaction` to create a new rule, then choose the trigger under `When`. Use the `Enabled` toggle to turn an individual interaction on or off without deleting it.

GOAT supports two types of interaction:

### Layer group activated → Switch tab

When a viewer activates a layer group, a Tabs widget switches to a tab you choose.

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">1</div>
  <div class="content">Set <code>When</code> to <code>Layer group activated</code>.</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">2</div>
  <div class="content">Select the <code>Target widget</code> — the Tabs widget whose active tab should change.</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">3</div>
  <div class="content">Under <code>Layer group</code> and <code>Tab</code>, map each layer group to the tab it should open. Click <code>Add mapping</code> to add more pairs.</div>
</div>

### Layer visibility changed → Sync visibility

When a viewer shows or hides a layer, one or more other layers are shown or hidden to match.

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">1</div>
  <div class="content">Set <code>When</code> to <code>Layer visibility changed</code>.</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">2</div>
  <div class="content">Select the <code>Source layer</code> — the layer whose visibility is watched.</div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div class="step-number">3</div>
  <div class="content">Add one or more <code>Target layers</code> that should mirror the source layer's visibility. Click <code>Add target layer</code> to add more.</div>
</div>
