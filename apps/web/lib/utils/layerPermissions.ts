 * a catalog layer is a shared read-only snapshot and every write to one is
 * refused with 403 "Catalog layers are read-only", so offering the action can
 * only produce an error toast. The owner may always edit, and a project editor
 * may edit a layer whose owner also edits that project.
 *
 * The client cannot see whether a *third* collaborator holds an edit grant,
 * so it approximates "layer owner is also an editor here" as "layer owner is
 * the project owner". That under-approximates: a layer contributed by another
 * collaborator shows no edit action even though the server would allow it.
 * Erring this way hides an action rather than surfacing one that 403s.
