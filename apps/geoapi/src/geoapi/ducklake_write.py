"""Write-capable DuckLake manager instance for GeoAPI.

Creates a read-write singleton instance of BaseDuckLakeManager from goatlib.
Used exclusively for mutation endpoints (feature CRUD, column management).
The existing read-only manager continues serving reads without contention.

DuckDB's single-writer constraint is handled by BaseDuckLakeManager's
internal threading.Lock, which serializes all write operations.

The connection is created lazily on first use rather than at startup. Every
DuckLake connection loads the full catalog file-set into native memory, so a
pod that only ever serves reads should not pay for a write connection it never
touches. Most geoapi traffic is read-only, so this drops the steady-state
connection count per pod.
