"""GTFS importer: a gtfs.zip → member layers for a ``pt_network_gtfs`` bundle.

Role → file and per-role column requirements are GTFS-specific and live here;
which roles are *required* comes from the spec. Every file becomes one layer
holding its rows and columns as published, all as text. Stops carry a geometry
alongside their own columns, and the shape points get a derived line layer for
the map; neither replaces the data it is drawn from.
