"""Anonymous endpoints related to custom-domain serving + UX hints.

Two callers, two query-param names on the lookup:
- Next.js middleware passes ``?host=<header>`` — its native vocabulary.
- Caddy's on_demand_tls ``ask`` callback hardcodes ``?domain=<sni>`` and
  cannot be reconfigured. Both are accepted here and treated identically.

Must NOT require authentication and must be cheap to call (single indexed
JOIN). Returns 404 when the host is unknown, inactive, or not assigned to
a published project.
