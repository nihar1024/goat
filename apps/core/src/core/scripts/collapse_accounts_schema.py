"""One-time operator migration: collapse the legacy ``accounts`` schema into the
configured data schema (``settings.SCHEMA``, default ``customer``).

Context: the accounts→core merge kept two physical schemas (``accounts`` +
``customer``) and merged code only. After the code-side collapse to a single
``SCHEMA``, existing databases still carry the ``accounts`` schema. This script
relocates those tables into ``settings.SCHEMA`` and drops the empty
``accounts`` schema. ``ALTER TABLE ... SET SCHEMA`` is metadata-only and FK
constraints survive (they are tracked by OID, not name).

Safety:
  * **dry-run by default** — prints the plan (clean moves + reconciles + any
    blocking collisions), changes nothing. Pass ``--apply`` to execute.
  * **reconcile expected duplicates** — the legacy two-schema layout left a
    redundant ``customer.user`` mirror alongside the canonical ``accounts.user``
    (see ``RECONCILE_TABLES``). The canonical table wins: its columns, data and
    FKs are kept and it additionally absorbs the mirror's inbound FKs (content
    tables — folder, project, layer, … — are re-pointed at it). Pre-validated:
    every id in the mirror must already exist in the canonical table, else the
    run aborts rather than orphan a dependent.
  * **collision precheck** — any *unexpected* duplicate table name (outside
    ``RECONCILE_TABLES``) aborts the run; resolve those by hand first.
  * **data-table guard** — after moving, the run refuses to drop ``accounts``
    if any data-bearing relation (table/view/sequence) is still in it, and
    rolls back. The legacy authz/trigger *functions* that the old two-schema
    layout kept in ``accounts`` are expected: they are listed, then dropped via
    ``DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE`` (along with the triggers that use them) and
    rebuilt into the data schema by ``initial_data``.
  * **single transaction** — a failure mid-way rolls the whole move back.
  * ``--rollback`` reverses a *clean* migration (recreates ``accounts`` and
    moves the canonical tables back). It does NOT resurrect a dropped legacy
    mirror — once a reconcile has run, restore from backup instead.

After ``--apply`` you MUST re-run ``initial_data`` so the PL/pgSQL functions
and triggers are reinstalled against the new schema.

Usage (from apps/core):
    uv run python -m core.scripts.collapse_accounts_schema            # dry-run
    uv run python -m core.scripts.collapse_accounts_schema --apply
    uv run python -m core.scripts.collapse_accounts_schema --rollback --apply

#     (``user_data.*``); actively harmful (their user-table triggers fail every
